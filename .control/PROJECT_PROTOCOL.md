# Phased Session Protocol for Claude Code Projects

A reusable protocol for running multi-phase, multi-session software projects with Claude Code without context rot or session drift. Portable — copy this file to any new project as a starting point.

The core idea in one line: **`.control/progress/STATE.md` is the single source of truth. Every session starts by reading it; every session ends by updating it. Everything else hangs off that.**

## When to use this

**Use it when:** the project will span multiple sessions over weeks or months, has ≥3 distinct phases, involves complex architectural decisions you want to preserve, or requires handoffs between people.

**Skip it when:** one-shot fix, weekend spike, or small feature work. The overhead is ~20 files of process infrastructure — real weight.

**Hard requirement:** the project must be a git repo. The protocol assumes commits map to steps and tags map to phases. No git = no rollback, no bisect, no history-as-narrative, no protocol. `git init` before anything else.

### Purpose of `.control/` vs `.claude/` vs `docs/`

| Path | Purpose | Who writes |
|---|---|---|
| `.control/` | Framework private area — version tracking, tunable config, hook snapshots | Framework (setup + hooks) |
| `.claude/` | Claude Code standard area — settings, slash commands, hook scripts | Framework (setup updates) |
| `docs/` | Project documentation — phases, issues, decisions, state | You + Claude per project |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `.control/PROJECT_PROTOCOL.md` | Root-level, visible | Installed by setup; project-specific tweaks allowed in `CLAUDE.md` |

The split lets `setup.sh --upgrade` refresh framework files (`.claude/*`, templates, runbooks) without touching project content.

---

## Quick-start: install via `setup.sh`

**Git is required** — the protocol depends on commits per step and tags per phase.

The `control/` framework source directory ships with `setup.sh`. Run it against a target project:

```bash
# Install into a new or existing project
cd /path/to/control
./setup.sh /path/to/target-project

# Or install into the current directory
cd /path/to/target-project
bash /path/to/control/setup.sh
```

The installer:
1. Verifies `git` and `bash` are available
2. Initialises git in the target if not already a repo
3. Copies `.control/`, `.claude/{settings.json,commands,hooks}`, `docs/` scaffolding, `CLAUDE.md`, `.control/PROJECT_PROTOCOL.md`
4. Appends Control entries to `.gitignore` (snapshots, local settings)
5. Creates an initial commit + `protocol-initialised` tag
6. Prints the next steps

### Upgrade an existing install

```bash
UPGRADE=1 bash /path/to/control/setup.sh /path/to/target-project
```

Upgrade mode refreshes **framework files** (commands, hooks, runbooks, templates) without touching **project content** (STATE.md, journal, phases, issues, ADRs).

### Manual scaffold (no installer)

If you can't run the installer, mirror its actions by hand:

```bash
git init
mkdir -p .control/snapshots .claude/{commands,hooks}
mkdir -p docs/{architecture/{decisions,interfaces},phases,progress,issues/{OPEN,RESOLVED},runbooks,templates}

# Copy each framework file from control/ to its target path
# (see the Directory layout section for where everything goes)

# Add gitignore entries
cat >> .gitignore <<'EOF'

# --- Control framework ---
.control/snapshots/
.claude/settings.local.json
# --- /Control ---
EOF

git add -A
git commit -m "chore: scaffold project protocol"
git tag protocol-initialised
```

Then fill `CLAUDE.md`, `.control/progress/STATE.md`, `.control/architecture/phase-plan.md`, and Phase 1 docs for the project specifics.

---

## File templates

Copy-paste these into the scaffolded files. Replace placeholders in `<angle-brackets>`.

### `CLAUDE.md` (project root)

Keep this small — it loads every session. Use pointers, not content.

```markdown
# Project: <name>

This project follows the **phased session protocol** — see `.control/runbooks/session-start.md`.

## At session start
1. Read `.control/progress/STATE.md`
2. Read the current phase's `README.md` and `steps.md` (path in STATE.md)
3. Check `.control/issues/OPEN/` for blockers
4. Report: phase, step, blockers, proposed next action
5. **Wait for user confirmation before editing code**

## Invariants
- **Git is not optional.** Every sub-step closes with a commit. Every phase closes with a tag (`phase-<N>-<name>-closed`). Never advance a step with uncommitted work unless STATE.md's "In-flight work" section explains why.
- **Commit message shape:** `<type>(<phase>.<step>): <subject>` — e.g. `feat(2.3): add DSPy QueryPlanner signature`, `fix(2.3): ISSUE-2026-04-19-themes-parse`, `test(2.3): eval regression for theme discovery`.
- Never edit accepted ADRs in `.control/architecture/decisions/` — they're immutable. New decisions get a new ADR that supersedes the old one (and mark the old as `superseded by ADR-<M>`).
- Never close a phase without running `/phase-close` (done-criteria verification + tag).
- Regression test required before any blocker/major issue moves to `RESOLVED/`.
- <add project-specific invariants here>

## Key references
- Full architecture: `.control/architecture/overview.md`
- Phase plan: `.control/architecture/phase-plan.md`
- Current state: `.control/progress/STATE.md`
```

### `.control/progress/STATE.md`

**The single most important file in the protocol.** Overwritten (not appended) at every `/session-end` and by the `PreCompact` hook. Read first at every session start. Every field exists to defeat a specific failure mode — don't prune.

```markdown
# Project State

> Single source of truth. Read this first every session. Updated at every
> `/session-end` and by the `PreCompact` hook. Every field has a purpose — fill each.

**Last updated:** <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC> by <session-id or "hook:pre-compact">
**Current phase:** <N> — <name>  (see `.control/phases/phase-<N>-<name>/`)
**Current step:** <N.M> — <short name>
**Status:** in-progress | blocked | done-criteria-pending | ready-to-close

---

## Next action
<One or two sentences. The very next concrete thing to do. If blocked, state the
blocker and what has to clear to unblock. No vagueness — if you can't articulate
the next action in a sentence, the step is wrong.>

---

## Git state
- **Branch:** <branch-name>
- **Last commit:** <short-sha> — <commit subject>
- **Uncommitted changes:** <yes — one-line summary of what / why uncommitted> | <none>
- **Last phase tag:** <tag-name> — <date>  (e.g. `phase-1-foundation-closed`)

*(If `Uncommitted changes: yes` at session start, that's a flag — either finish and commit, or document why it's intentional in "In-flight work" below.)*

---

## Open blockers
- None
  *or*
- [ISSUE-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>] severity:<blocker|major> — <one-line> — `.control/issues/OPEN/...`

---

## In-flight work
Files currently mid-edit, partially implemented, or in-review. Empty if the last
session ended with everything committed.

- `path/to/file.py` — <what's done, what's missing, what to do next>
- ...

---

## Test / eval status
- **Last test run:** <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> — <pass | fail (N failing)> — `<test command>`
- **Eval score** (agent phases only): <current> — baseline: <baseline>, target: <target>
- **Regression tests:** all green | <N> failing — see `<path>`

*(If any are failing, they block phase-close. Fix or open an issue.)*

---

## Recent decisions (last 3 ADRs)
- ADR-<NNNN>: <title> — <YYYY-MM-DD> — status: <accepted|proposed>
- ...

Full context in `.control/architecture/decisions/`.

---

## Recently completed (last 5 steps)
- <N.M> — <action> — <YYYY-MM-DD> — commit `<short-sha>`
- <N.M-1> — <action> — <YYYY-MM-DD> — commit `<short-sha>`

---

## Attempts that didn't work (current step only)
Approaches tried and ruled out for the *current* step. Stops the next session
re-trying the same dead-end. Cleared when the step closes. If a rejected
approach is structurally important, write an ADR instead.

- <approach> — rejected because <reason>

---

## Environment snapshot
Only update when it changes. Helps diagnose "it worked yesterday" failures.

- **Language / runtime:** <e.g. Python 3.12.1>
- **Key pinned deps:** <packages whose version matters to current work>
- **Model in use** (if relevant): <backend / model-id>
- **Other:** <anything non-default that affects behaviour — OS-specific flags, env vars>

---

## Notes for next session
<Catchall — unresolved debates, quirks discovered mid-session, user preferences
that came up in chat, things worth keeping an eye on. Anything that would make
a cold-start session say "wait, what?">
```

**Why each field exists:**

| Field | Defeats |
|---|---|
| Last updated / Current phase-step / Status | Cold-start "where are we?" |
| Next action | "What do I do first?" paralysis |
| Git state | Divergence between what's in files vs what's committed |
| Open blockers | Forgetting about a known-broken thing |
| In-flight work | Losing mid-edit context across sessions |
| Test / eval status | Pushing forward while tests are red |
| Recent decisions | Rehashing settled arguments |
| Recently completed | "What just changed?" confusion |
| Attempts that didn't work | Re-trying the same dead-end |
| Environment snapshot | "Worked yesterday" regressions |
| Notes for next session | Everything else that doesn't fit a field |

### `.control/progress/journal.md`

Append-only, newest on top. One entry per session, short. Minor-fix bugs (severity-gated — see Issue flow) also land here as one-line entries instead of getting their own file.

```markdown
# Journal

## <YYYY-MM-DD> — Session <short-id>
- Phase <N>, steps <N.M> → <N.M+1>  (commits: <sha-range>)
- <key decisions made, with ADR refs>
- Issues opened: <IDs with severity>
- Issues closed: <IDs>
- Minor fixes: <symptom> in <file> — commit <sha>
- <significant blockers hit>

## <earlier date> — Session <earlier-id>
- ...
```

### `.control/progress/next.md`

Overwritten each session end. Self-contained prompt the user pastes into a fresh session.

```markdown
# Next session — paste this to start

Continue the <project name> build.

Read `CLAUDE.md`, then `.control/progress/STATE.md`, then the current phase README
and steps file referenced in STATE.md. Check `.control/issues/OPEN/` for blockers.

Report back a 4-line status: phase / step / open blockers / proposed next action.
Then wait for me to confirm before editing code.

Current context (as of <session-end-date>):
- Phase <N> — <name>, at step <N.M>
- <one-line note on where work is mid-flight, if applicable>

## Decisions awaiting your input

*(Optional — populate when an upcoming step has a design choice that needs operator
judgment. Empty when there are none. The session-start protocol expands every entry
here into full option detail before asking for go. Do NOT shorthand options as
labeled footnotes — the next session's reader needs the full context up front.)*

- **<short title of the decision>**
  - Context: <one or two sentences on why the decision is open>
  - Options: <list each option with what concretely changes, what the operator sees,
    cost / scope impact, and the trade-off being accepted — the shape the
    session-start protocol will expand to>
  - Recommendation: <preferred option with the trade-off named, or "no lean">
```

### `.control/phases/phase-N-<name>/README.md`

```markdown
# Phase <N> — <Name>

**Dependencies:** Phase <N-1> closed
**Estimated duration:** ~<X> sessions

## Goal
<One sentence — what problem does this phase solve?>

## Outcome
<What exists / works at the end that didn't before? User-visible when possible.>

## Sub-steps
See `steps.md` for the detailed checklist.

## Done criteria
All must be verified before `/phase-close` advances:

- [ ] All items in `steps.md` checked off, each with a commit reference
- [ ] `.control/issues/OPEN/` contains no items tagged `phase:<N>-blocker`
- [ ] Automated tests pass: `<exact command>`
- [ ] <Phase-specific verifiable criterion — e.g. eval score ≥ baseline>
- [ ] Smoke test: <specific manual action and expected result>
- [ ] Working tree is clean (`git status` shows nothing to commit)
- [ ] All commits follow the `<type>(<phase>.<step>): <subject>` convention
- [ ] Phase will be tagged `phase-<N>-<name>-closed` by `/phase-close`

## Rollback plan
If this phase's changes need to be undone: `git reset --hard phase-<N-1>-<prev-name>-closed`
then force-push if applicable. Document any state that doesn't roll back with git
(external resources created, migrations applied, etc.).

## ADRs decided in this phase
- <will be filled in as decisions are made>
```

### `.control/phases/phase-N-<name>/steps.md`

```markdown
# Phase <N> Steps

- [ ] <N>.1 — <concrete action>
- [ ] <N>.2 — <concrete action>
- [ ] <N>.3 — <concrete action>

## Sub-step detail

### <N>.2 — <action>
<What exactly to do. What to verify. Links to interface/decision docs.>

### <N>.3 — <action>
...
```

### `.control/templates/issue.md`

Only used for **major** and **blocker** severity. Minor bugs never create a file — they get a one-line entry in `journal.md` and an inline fix.

```markdown
# ISSUE-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>

**Severity:** blocker | major   *(minor bugs don't get a file)*
**Discovered:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Phase/step:** <N.M>
**Status:** open | in-progress | fix-pending-test | resolved
**Tags:** `phase:<N>-blocker` if blocking current phase | <other>

## Symptom
<What's wrong, concretely observable.>

## Repro
1. <steps>
2. ...

## Hypothesis
<Best guess at cause. Update as investigation proceeds.>

## Resolution
*(Filled in when fixed — refuses close without all three.)*
- **Fix commit:** `<sha>` — <one-line>
- **Regression test:** `<path>` — covers <specific failure mode>
- **Diff summary:** <what changed and why>
```

### `.control/templates/adr.md`

```markdown
# ADR-<NNNN>: <Decision title>

**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Status:** proposed | accepted | superseded by ADR-<M>
**Phase when decided:** <N>

## Context
<The forces at play, the problem, the constraints.>

## Decision
<The choice made.>

## Alternatives considered
- <Option A> — rejected because <reason>
- <Option B> — rejected because <reason>

## Consequences
- Positive: <...>
- Negative: <...>
- Follow-up work: <...>
```

### `.control/runbooks/session-start.md`

```markdown
# Session start protocol

1. **Read state** — `.control/progress/STATE.md`. Note every field: phase, step, next action, git state, blockers, in-flight work, test/eval status, recent decisions, attempts that didn't work, notes.
2. **Read phase context** — the README and steps files for the phase path in STATE.md.
3. **Scan open issues** — list every file in `.control/issues/OPEN/`. Identify items tagged as blockers for the current phase.
4. **Verify git** — run `git status --porcelain`, `git log -1 --oneline`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`. Compare against STATE.md's Git state section. Any mismatch is a drift signal — flag it, don't silently proceed.
5. **Report to user**, in this exact shape:
   ```
   Phase <N> — <name>, step <N.M>
   Last action: <what was done last>
   Git: branch=<...>, last=<sha> <subject>, uncommitted=<yes/no>, tag=<last phase tag>
   Git sync: ✓ matches STATE.md  OR  ⚠ drift: <details>
   Open blockers: <count, with IDs> OR None
   Test/eval status: <from STATE.md>
   Proposed next action: <from STATE.md>
   Ready to proceed?
   ```
5b. **Design decisions awaiting operator input.** If `.control/progress/next.md` surfaces a `## Decisions awaiting your input` section, or STATE.md's "Notes for next session" / "Next action" flags an open design choice for the upcoming step, expand it inline before asking for go. For each option present: **(i) what concretely changes** (schema additions, code shape, file additions), **(ii) what the operator sees** (sample CLI output, sample data shape, sample error), **(iii) cost / scope impact** (how it affects the current step's budget and surrounding work), **(iv) trade-off being accepted** (what each option costs, not just what it gains). End with a recommendation that names the trade-off, not just the lean. Do not shorthand design choices as labeled footnotes (`(a)` / `(b)` with one-line summaries) — that forces the operator to ask for the detail in a second turn, wasting context.
6. **Wait for confirmation.** Do not edit code before the user says go.
```

### `.control/runbooks/session-end.md`

```markdown
# Session end protocol

Trigger: phase boundary, context getting heavy, or user says wrap up.

1. **Check git.** Run `git status --porcelain`. If dirty, either commit now (propose a message following `<type>(<phase>.<step>): <subject>`) or record the reason in STATE.md's In-flight work section. Uncommitted-without-explanation is a protocol violation.

2. **Update `.control/progress/STATE.md`** — overwrite every section:
   - Last updated (UTC timestamp + session id)
   - Current phase / step / status
   - Next action (concrete and actionable)
   - Git state (branch, last commit, uncommitted, last phase tag)
   - Open blockers (with issue IDs)
   - In-flight work (files mid-edit with what's left)
   - Test / eval status (last run, score)
   - Recent decisions (last 3 ADRs)
   - Recently completed (last 5 steps with commit shas)
   - Attempts that didn't work (current step's dead-ends)
   - Environment snapshot (if changed)
   - Notes for next session

3. **Append to `.control/progress/journal.md`** (newest on top):
   - Date + session id
   - Phase / step range (with commit sha range)
   - Decisions made (with ADR refs)
   - Issues opened / closed
   - Minor fixes (severity-gated — inline per the Issue flow section)
   - Significant blockers hit

4. **Write `.control/progress/next.md`** — self-contained prompt for the next session. Must reference STATE.md + current phase docs so a cold-start bootstrap works.

5. **Commit the docs updates** — `docs(state): session end for step <N.M>`.

6. **Print the next prompt** — "Paste this to start your next session."
```

## Slash commands

Save each as a file in `.claude/commands/`. They become invocable as `/session-start`, `/new-issue foo`, etc.

### `.claude/commands/session-start.md`

```markdown
---
description: Run the session bootstrap protocol
---

Follow `.control/runbooks/session-start.md` exactly:

1. Read `.control/progress/STATE.md`.
2. Read the current phase's `README.md` and `steps.md` (path in STATE.md).
3. List files in `.control/issues/OPEN/` and identify blockers for the current phase.
4. **Verify git state matches STATE.md.** Run `git status --porcelain`, `git log -1 --oneline`, `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`. Compare against STATE.md's "Git state" section. If any mismatch (last commit sha differs, uncommitted changes STATE.md doesn't mention, branch differs, etc.), flag it before reporting status.
5. Report a status block:
   ```
   Phase <N> — <name>, step <N.M>
   Last action: <from STATE.md's recently completed[0]>
   Git: branch=<...>, last=<sha> <subject>, uncommitted=<yes/no>, tag=<last phase tag>
   Git sync: ✓ matches STATE.md  OR  ⚠ drift detected: <what>
   Open blockers: <count, with IDs> OR None
   Test/eval status: <from STATE.md>
   Proposed next action: <from STATE.md>
   Ready to proceed?
   ```
5b. **Design decisions awaiting operator input.** If `.control/progress/next.md` surfaces a `## Decisions awaiting your input` section, or STATE.md's "Notes for next session" / "Next action" flags an open design choice for the upcoming step, expand it inline before asking for go. For each option present: **(i) what concretely changes** (schema additions, code shape, file additions), **(ii) what the operator sees** (sample CLI output, sample data shape, sample error), **(iii) cost / scope impact** (how it affects the current step's budget and surrounding work), **(iv) trade-off being accepted** (what each option costs, not just what it gains). End with a recommendation that names the trade-off, not just the lean. Do not shorthand design choices as labeled footnotes (`(a)` / `(b)` with one-line summaries) — that forces the operator to ask for the detail in a second turn, wasting context.
6. Wait for the user's go before editing any code.
```

### `.claude/commands/session-end.md`

```markdown
---
description: Close the session — update STATE.md, check git, write next-session prompt, journal
---

Follow `.control/runbooks/session-end.md`:

1. **Check git state.** Run `git status --porcelain` and `git log -1 --oneline`.
   - If working tree is dirty, ask the user: commit now? If yes, help compose a commit message following the `<type>(<phase>.<step>): <subject>` convention. If no, record the reason in STATE.md's "In-flight work" section.

2. **Update `.control/progress/STATE.md`** — overwrite with:
   - Last updated: current UTC timestamp + session id
   - Current phase / step / status
   - Next action (concrete, one or two sentences)
   - Git state: branch, last commit sha + subject, uncommitted yes/no, last phase tag
   - Open blockers: list with issue IDs, or "None"
   - In-flight work: any files mid-edit and what's left
   - Test / eval status: last run result, score, any failures
   - Recent decisions: last 3 ADRs with numbers + dates
   - Recently completed: last 5 steps with commit shas
   - Attempts that didn't work: current-step dead-ends (cleared when step closes)
   - Environment snapshot: only if it changed
   - Notes for next session: catchall

3. **Append to `.control/progress/journal.md`** (newest on top):
   - Date + session id
   - Phase / step range covered
   - Key decisions (with ADR refs)
   - Issues opened (IDs) and closed (IDs)
   - Minor fixes made inline (per severity-gated flow)
   - Significant blockers hit

4. **Write `.control/progress/next.md`** — self-contained prompt for the next session that references STATE.md and the current phase README.

5. **Print the next prompt** with "Paste this to start your next session."
```

### `.claude/commands/new-issue.md`

```markdown
---
description: Open a new issue — severity-gated (minor = journal line, major/blocker = file)
argument-hint: <slug>
---

Before creating anything, ask the user two questions:

1. **Symptom** — one-line description of what's wrong.
2. **Severity** — blocker | major | minor.
   - *blocker*: prevents phase advancement
   - *major*: needs tracking + regression test, but not blocking
   - *minor*: typo / obvious fix / cosmetic — no file, no regression test required

**If minor:**
- Do NOT create a file.
- Fix it inline in this session.
- Commit the fix.
- Append a journal line: `- Minor fix: <symptom> in <file> — commit <short-sha>`.
- Done.

**If major or blocker:**
- Create `.control/issues/OPEN/<today>-$ARGUMENTS.md` from `.control/templates/issue.md`.
- Fill: Discovered (today), Phase/step (from STATE.md), Symptom, Severity, Tags (`phase:<N>-blocker` if blocker).
- Append journal: `- Opened ISSUE-<today>-$ARGUMENTS (severity:<sev>) — <symptom>`.
- If blocker, update `.control/progress/STATE.md` open blockers list.
```

description: Close a major/blocker issue after verifying a regression test exists
argument-hint: <issue-id>
---

This command is for **blocker and major** issues only. Minor bugs are fixed inline via `/new-issue` and never create a file — nothing to close.

Given issue ID `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. Read `.control/issues/OPEN/$ARGUMENTS.md`.
2. **Verify a regression test exists** that would have caught this bug — grep tests for the issue ID or the specific failure mode. If none, stop and ask the user to add one before closing. Do not proceed without it.
3. Verify the fix and test have been committed. Record the fix commit sha.
4. Fill in the Resolution section: commit refs (fix + regression test), diff summary, regression test path.
5. Move the file from `.control/issues/OPEN/` to `.control/issues/RESOLVED/`.
6. Commit the move: `docs(issues): resolve $ARGUMENTS`.
7. If this was a blocker, update `.control/progress/STATE.md` to remove it from the open blockers list.
8. Append a journal entry: "Closed $ARGUMENTS — fix `<sha>`, regression test at `<path>`".
```

### `.claude/commands/phase-close.md`

```markdown
---
description: Verify done criteria, tag phase, and scaffold the next phase
---

For the current phase (from `.control/progress/STATE.md`):

1. **Check working tree is clean.** Run `git status --porcelain`. If non-empty, stop and ask the user to commit or stash. Do not advance.
2. Re-read the current phase's `README.md` done criteria.
3. Verify each criterion. For automated ones, run the commands and report results. For manual ones, ask the user to confirm.
4. Verify `.control/issues/OPEN/` has no items tagged `phase:<N>-blocker`.
5. Verify test / eval status in STATE.md is green.
6. **If any criterion fails, stop.** List what's missing. Do not advance.
7. If all pass:
   - Create the phase tag: `git tag phase-<N>-<name>-closed` with a message summarising what shipped.
   - Update `.control/progress/STATE.md`: current phase → `<N+1>`, step → `<N+1>.1`, Last-phase-tag → the new tag, reset "Attempts that didn't work" and "In-flight work", update next action.
   - Scaffold `.control/phases/phase-<N+1>-<name>/` with `README.md` and `steps.md` seeded from `.control/architecture/phase-plan.md`.
   - Write the kickoff prompt to `.control/progress/next.md`.
   - Commit: `chore(phase-<N>): close phase <N>, kick off phase <N+1>`.
   - Append a journal entry: "Phase <N> closed (tag: `phase-<N>-<name>-closed`, commit: `<sha>`); Phase <N+1> kicked off."
   - Print the next-session prompt for the user.
```

### `.claude/commands/new-adr.md`

```markdown
---
description: Create a new Architecture Decision Record
argument-hint: <short-title-slug>
---

Find the highest-numbered ADR in `.control/architecture/decisions/` and increment.

Create `.control/architecture/decisions/<NNNN>-$ARGUMENTS.md` from `.control/templates/adr.md`.

Prompt the user for:
- Context, Decision, Alternatives considered, Consequences.

Set Status to `proposed` initially. The user changes it to `accepted` once they confirm.

After it's accepted, append a reference in the current phase README under "ADRs decided in this phase".
```

### `.claude/commands/work-next.md`

The prioritizer — picks the next item without being told. This is the command that enables autonomous operation when combined with `/loop`.

```markdown
---
description: Autonomously pick and execute the next item per the protocol's priority rules
---

Read `.control/progress/STATE.md`. Apply this priority order — do the first one that matches, then stop:

1. **Any open blocker in STATE.md's "Open blockers" list?**
   - If yes and a clear hypothesis exists in the issue file → investigate + fix + regression test + `/close-issue`.
   - If yes and no clear hypothesis → **HALT** (see pause conditions below).

2. **Tests or eval failing per STATE.md's "Test / eval status"?**
   - If the fix is obvious and contained → fix + commit + re-run.
   - If ambiguous or requires domain knowledge → **HALT**.

3. **Unchecked item in the current phase's `steps.md`?**
   - Implement the next unchecked step.
   - Respect pause-for-human conditions during the work.
   - Commit: `<type>(<phase>.<step>): <subject>`.

4. **All steps checked but phase not yet closed?**
   - Run `/phase-close`. If criteria fail, surface what's missing.

5. **Phase closed, next phase scaffolded?**
   - Pick step 1 of the new phase and start.

6. **All phases complete per phase-plan.md?**
   - **HALT** with: "All phases complete. No work queued."

After executing the chosen action:
- Update STATE.md (every field, per session-end protocol).
- Append `journal.md`.
- Commit the docs updates.

### Pause-for-human conditions — HALT the loop

Stop immediately, run `/session-end`, and surface to the user when any of these hit:

- **New ADR needed** — a non-trivial architectural choice came up. Don't silently decide; prompt `/new-adr`.
- **Blocker with no clear hypothesis** — investigation exhausted.
- **Ambiguous failing test** — multiple plausible fixes, no clear winner.
- **Manual smoke test** in a phase's done criteria.
- **User-acceptance** criterion.
- **Secret or credential needed** — API key, auth token, anything outside the repo.
- **Destructive action required** — delete, force-push, drop table, migration rollback.
- **Iteration budget hit** — see Autonomy model section.

Halt format:

\`\`\`
[HALT] <reason>
Current step: <N.M>
What's needed from you: <concrete ask>
STATE.md updated. Resume with /work-next or /loop /work-next when ready.
\`\`\`
```

### `.claude/commands/bootstrap.md`

Derives project-specific content from a spec/PRD file and populates Control's scaffolding. One-shot at project start — reads the spec, produces project-specific invariants for CLAUDE.md, a distilled `overview.md`, a full `phase-plan.md` with all phases, and the Phase 1 scaffold. Argument: path to the spec file (e.g. `/bootstrap insights_engine_new.md`).

**When to run:** immediately after `setup.sh`/`setup.ps1` completes, before any code work begins. Replaces the manual "edit CLAUDE.md, fill overview, enumerate phases, scaffold phase-1" ritual with one command + a review cycle.

**What it does not do:** scaffold phases 2+. Those come from `/phase-close` as each phase ships — just-in-time, so detailed sub-steps reflect lessons from earlier phases.

```markdown
---
description: Derive project-specific content from a spec file and populate Control's scaffolding
argument-hint: <path-to-spec-file>
---

(See `.claude/commands/bootstrap.md` in an installed project for the full instructions.)
```

### `.claude/commands/validate.md`

Sanity-checks the protocol scaffolding for consistency — STATE.md fields populated, phase paths resolve, ADR numbering contiguous, issue files well-formed, git tags align with claimed phase closes. Reports; does not auto-fix.

```markdown
---
description: Sanity-check Control protocol files for consistency
---

Run all checks defined in `control/.claude/commands/validate.md`. Report a summary; halt if errors.
```

Run it: before autonomy graduation, before a long `/loop /work-next`, and whenever STATE.md feels off.

---

## Session protocol

### Start

User types `/session-start` (or pastes the prompt from `.control/progress/next.md`). Claude bootstraps from state files, reports a 4-line status, waits for go.

### During

- TaskCreate/TaskUpdate for the session's in-flight checklist (ephemeral — session-scoped).
- Journal entries appended at **significant** events only: major decisions, issues opened, issues closed, steps completed. Not at every file edit.
- Issues opened as they're discovered via `/new-issue`.
- ADRs created via `/new-adr` for any non-trivial architectural choice.

### End

User types `/session-end` — or Claude proactively suggests it when context gets heavy or a phase boundary is reached. Claude updates STATE.md, appends journal, writes `next.md`, prints the prompt.

---

## State persistence layer

The manual protocol requires discipline — remember to `/session-end`, remember to update STATE.md. Claude Code's hook system automates the critical pieces so state persistence isn't opt-in. This is where the real anti-drift automation lives.

### Hook events that matter

Control uses four hook events, each tackling a specific failure mode:

| Hook | Fires | Defeats | Script |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`PreCompact`** | Before Claude Code compacts the conversation to free context | "Lost what we were doing when context collapsed" | `.claude/hooks/pre-compact-dump.sh` |
| **`SessionStart`** | At the beginning of every session | "Cold start with no context" | `.claude/hooks/session-start-load.sh` |
| **`SessionEnd`** | When a session shuts down (user quits, terminal closed) | "Session ended without running /session-end" | `.claude/hooks/session-end-commit.sh` |
| **`Stop`** | After each Claude response completes | "STATE.md drifted between session end calls" | `.claude/hooks/stop-snapshot.sh` |

Configured in `.claude/settings.json` (project-scoped) or `~/.claude/settings.json` (global).

**Layering rationale:**
- `PreCompact` + `SessionEnd` = reactive capture at the two points where state is at risk.
- `SessionStart` = cold-boot bootstrap.
- `Stop` = proactive per-turn snapshot (cheap — only writes when STATE.md changed). Alternative to a status-line script; remove if the overhead is noticeable.

All snapshots land in `.control/snapshots/` (gitignored) with timestamped filenames. Pruned automatically to the last N snapshots (default 50) or N days (default 14), configurable via `.control/config.sh`.

### `.claude/settings.json` (installed by setup.sh)

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/hooks/pre-compact-dump.sh" } ] }
    ],
    "SessionStart": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/hooks/session-start-load.sh" } ] }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/hooks/session-end-commit.sh" } ] }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      { "matcher": "", "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "bash .claude/hooks/stop-snapshot.sh" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

> Verify the exact hook-config shape against current Claude Code docs before shipping — event names are stable, but matcher/envelope syntax has evolved across versions.

### Hook scripts

All scripts live in `.claude/hooks/`, POSIX bash, runnable on Windows via Git Bash. The four main hooks and one helper:

**`pre-compact-dump.sh`** — snapshots `.control/progress/{STATE,journal,next}.md` to `.control/snapshots/` with a timestamp. Appends a journal marker. Triggers `prune-snapshots.sh`.

**`session-start-load.sh`** — emits a bootstrap prompt referencing STATE.md + git state. Claude reads it on session start and follows the protocol automatically.

**`session-end-commit.sh`** — snapshots state at actual session shutdown. Writes a `sessionend-dirty-<ts>.flag` file if the working tree is uncommitted at shutdown, so the next session sees the warning.

**`stop-snapshot.sh`** — per-turn proactive snapshot. Only writes `.control/snapshots/current.md` if STATE.md content changed (cheap).

**`prune-snapshots.sh`** — helper: removes snapshots older than `snapshot_retention_days` (default 14) or beyond `snapshot_retention_count` (default 50). Called by PreCompact and SessionEnd.

For the full hook script contents, see `control/.claude/hooks/*.sh` in the framework source, or look at `.claude/hooks/*.sh` in an installed project.

### Why multiple layers (reactive + proactive)

`PreCompact` alone is insufficient — compaction triggers are unreliable and can fire at times that don't align with session boundaries (tracked in `anthropics/claude-code#43733`). Control uses four:

- **`SessionStart`** (cold-boot) — reads STATE.md + git state, emits the bootstrap prompt so Claude starts the session already oriented.
- **`PreCompact`** (reactive, context-collapse) — snapshots state before compaction runs, so nothing is lost when history is compressed.
- **`SessionEnd`** (reactive, shutdown) — final snapshot when the session closes, plus an uncommitted-tree flag if the shutdown was dirty.
- **`Stop`** (proactive, per-turn) — snapshots STATE.md after every Claude response, but only if content changed. Cheap insurance against slow drift between session-end calls.

The four together cover: cold start, catastrophic context loss, voluntary shutdown, and slow drift. Remove `Stop` if per-turn overhead becomes noticeable.

### Prior art

**ClaudeFast's Code Kit** packages a similar pattern — their `ContextRecoveryHook` auto-backs up architectural decisions, patterns, and progress before compaction fires; their status-line approach is a stronger proactive variant. Worth reviewing if Control's `Stop` hook isn't sufficient.

### Enforcement lattice

| Layer | Mechanism | Example | Installed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Manual | User discipline | Remembers to run `/session-end` | — |
| Semi-automated | Slash commands + templates | `/close-issue` refuses without regression test | `setup.sh` |
| **Reactive hooks** | `PreCompact`, `SessionEnd` | Snapshot state before compaction / on shutdown | `setup.sh` (settings.json + scripts) |
| **Proactive hooks** | `SessionStart`, `Stop` | Auto-bootstrap; per-turn snapshot when STATE.md changes | `setup.sh` (settings.json + scripts) |

All layers ship wired up in Control v1+. The progressive-adoption story now lives in the **Autonomy model** section (stages 0→3) — once the framework is installed, you decide how much autonomy to grant, not whether to install the persistence.

Don't skip the underlying STATE.md discipline — hooks without it just dump garbage at high frequency.

---

## Autonomy model

The protocol + `/work-next` + Claude Code's `/loop` skill together let Claude run the build autonomously — picking the next item, working on it, committing, updating state, and moving on — with explicit halt conditions for human judgment.

### Why `/loop /work-next` is the answer to "I can't /clear myself"

Claude Code intentionally reserves `/clear` for the user — a model that could wipe its own session could also erase unfinished work mid-task. You don't actually need `/clear` for autonomous operation:

- `/loop /work-next` keeps Claude working **within one session**, iterating through steps.
- The `PreCompact` hook handles the context-fills-up case automatically — state dumps to disk before compaction, and post-compaction Claude resumes by reading STATE.md.
- The `SessionStart` hook handles the truly-new-session case — if you close the terminal, starting again auto-bootstraps from STATE.md.

Result: paste `/loop /work-next` once, walk away, come back to progress. The `/clear` limit never bites in practice.

### Staged rollout

**Do not flip to full autonomy on day one.** Earn trust stage by stage.

| Stage | Trigger | What runs autonomous | What you do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0. Manual** | You type each command | Nothing — you drive | Run `/session-start`, `/work-next`, `/session-end` manually. Validate the priority logic. |
| **1. Semi-auto** | You say "go" / "continue" | `/work-next` picks + executes one item, then stops | Review after each step. One word per step. |
| **2. Step-loop** | `/loop /work-next` | Claude self-paces step → step → step within one session until a HALT | Review at natural breakpoints (typically phase close). |
| **3. Phase-loop** | `/loop /work-next` with phase-close auto-approved | Claude advances across phases; halts only on ADRs, blockers, manual criteria | Review at end of each phase. |

**Move up only when the previous stage felt solid.** Skipping to stage 3 on a greenfield project is how you wake up to 100 commits of confidently wrong work.

### The `/loop` invocation

Once at stage 2+:

```
/loop /work-next
```

No interval — Claude self-paces, scheduling the next iteration via `ScheduleWakeup` when the current one completes. The loop runs until a HALT condition fires or the iteration budget is exhausted.

### Iteration budget

Hard cap on autonomous iterations per `/loop` invocation. Belt and suspenders against runaway loops or priority-logic bugs.

- **Default:** 20 iterations.
- **Configurable:** set `MAX_AUTO_ITERATIONS` near the top of `.claude/commands/work-next.md` and reference it in the halt logic.

On budget exhaustion, Claude:
1. Runs `/session-end` (updates STATE.md, commits docs).
2. Surfaces: `[BUDGET] Hit iteration cap of N. Review progress; restart with /loop /work-next when ready.`
3. Stops.

This ensures a check-in at least every N iterations even when nothing else halts the loop.

### What autonomous mode is and isn't for

**Good fit:**
- Executing a phase plan that's already designed
- Grinding through routine sub-steps (scaffolding, plumbing, tests)
- Fixing blocker issues where a hypothesis is already written down
- Running through the done-criteria of a phase

**Bad fit:**
- Before the protocol is proven — run stage 0 manually through at least one phase first
- Destructive or irreversible work — migrations, force-pushes, production changes; always human-gated
- Exploratory / research work — autonomy executes a plan, it doesn't design one
- Thin eval/test coverage — without regression protection, bad fixes compound silently

### Interrupt anytime

Autonomy is opt-in per session and interruptible. Whatever Claude is doing:
- Send any message to interrupt the loop.
- `/session-end` cleanly halts, commits state, prepares the next prompt.
- Ctrl+C at the CLI stops the current turn.

You're never locked in. The loop is a convenience, not a contract.

---

## Phase structure

Each phase is a self-contained unit with:

| Element | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Goal** (1 sentence) | What problem this phase solves |
| **Outcome** | What exists after that didn't before (user-visible) |
| **Sub-steps** (3-8) | Concrete, verifiable items |
| **Done criteria** | Tests pass, no open blockers, manual smoke |
| **Rollback plan** | How to undo if needed |
| **Dependencies** | Which prior phases must be closed |

**A phase cannot close** until done criteria verify via `/phase-close`. This is the primary enforcement point of the protocol. If you skip it, everything else degrades.

### Git discipline

The protocol only works if git history mirrors the phase/step structure. Conventions:

| Event | Git action |
|---|---|
| Sub-step closed | Commit with message `<type>(<phase>.<step>): <subject>` |
| ADR accepted | Commit alone: `docs(adr): ADR-<NNNN> <title>` |
| Issue closed (major/blocker) | Commit with fix + regression test: `fix(<phase>.<step>): ISSUE-<id>` |
| Phase closed | Tag: `phase-<N>-<name>-closed` — set by `/phase-close` |
| Protocol bootstrap | Tag: `protocol-initialised` |

**Why per-step commits:**
- `git log` becomes a readable progress narrative parallel to the journal.
- `git bisect` works across step boundaries when a regression sneaks in.
- Rollback to `phase-<N-1>-<name>-closed` is a real escape hatch, not a hope.
- STATE.md's "Last commit" field becomes a cross-check that the session actually shipped what it claims.

**Uncommitted work at session end is a protocol violation** unless STATE.md's "In-flight work" explains why (e.g. mid-refactor, paused for user review). `/session-end` flags uncommitted changes and prompts to commit or document.

**Branching:** trunk-based works fine for single-developer Claude-driven work. Use feature branches only when the phase is large enough that you want parallel lines of work — otherwise overhead doesn't pay back. Tag the branch's merge commit as the phase close.

---

## Issue flow

Severity drives flow — the OPEN/ directory is for things that need tracking, not every typo.

### Severity rules

| Severity | Flow | Regression test | Blocks phase-close? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **blocker** | Full file in `.control/issues/OPEN/` | Required before close | Yes |
| **major** | Full file in `.control/issues/OPEN/` | Required before close | If tagged `phase:<N>-blocker` |
| **minor** | **Journal line only, fix inline** | Not required (but encouraged) | Never |

A **minor** bug is: a small, contained fix (typo, obvious off-by-one, a cosmetic UI nit) that doesn't change architecture, doesn't need investigation, and can be fixed and committed in the same action. A brief line in `journal.md` is enough:

```
- Minor fix: <what was wrong> in <file> — commit <short-sha>
```

Anything that requires investigation, a hypothesis, or touches more than one file is not minor — file it.

### Full flow (blocker / major)

```
Discovered → /new-issue <slug> → .control/issues/OPEN/<date>-<slug>.md
              │
              ├─ fix in progress  (update Status field)
              │
              ├─ regression test written  (this is the gate)
              │
              └─ /close-issue <id> → .control/issues/RESOLVED/
```

The **regression test gate** is load-bearing for blocker/major. A fix without a test is a patch, not a resolution — the bug will come back. `/close-issue` refuses without one.

### Why severity-gating matters

Without it, the OPEN/ directory fills with noise (typo fixes, imports in wrong order) and the signal-to-noise drops until people stop reading it. Severity makes the OPEN/ list a real worklist.

---

## Per-project customisation

Fill these in when you spin up a new project:

1. **Phase plan** — in `.control/architecture/phase-plan.md`. Enumerate N phases with one-sentence goals and dependency edges.
2. **Done-criteria patterns** — some phases might need eval scores, load tests, security reviews. Bake into the phase README template.
3. **Invariants in CLAUDE.md** — project-specific "never do X" rules (e.g. "never import `openai` directly", "no migrations without an ADR").
4. **Tags** — extend `phase:<N>-blocker` with project-specific tags like `security`, `performance` if you need cross-cutting views.
5. **SessionEnd hook (optional)** — configure via Claude Code settings to block session end until STATE.md's `Last updated` timestamp changes. Stronger enforcement, slightly annoying. Worth it for larger builds.

---

## Common pitfalls

**STATE.md not updated at session end.** The single biggest failure mode. Next session boots with stale state, drifts. Mitigation: the `/session-end` command + optional hook; make it a non-optional step, not a nice-to-have.

**CLAUDE.md bloat.** Every session reads it. Keep it under 50 lines. Long prose belongs in runbooks, pointed to by CLAUDE.md.

**Journal as scratchpad.** Journal entries should be short and event-driven, not a stream-of-consciousness log. If it grows past ~200 entries, archive the oldest half to `.control/progress/journal-archive-<year>.md`.

**ADR revisionism.** ADRs are immutable once accepted. If a decision changes, write a new ADR that **supersedes** the old one (and mark the old one superseded in its Status field). Do not edit accepted ADRs.

**Skipping `/phase-close`.** "We're basically done, let's just move on." No. If done criteria aren't verifiable, they're not met. The protocol's value is precisely the forced verification. Skip it once and you'll skip it always.

**Issue files without regression tests.** Closing an issue without a regression test means that bug will come back, and worse — you'll have to re-investigate from scratch. `/close-issue` enforces this; don't bypass it by moving files manually.

**Memory vs. docs/ confusion.** Auto memory (`~/.claude/projects/...`) is for durable user/project facts — "user is a senior data engineer", "prefers Postgres over MySQL". `docs/` is for this project's operational state — current phase, open issues. Don't put operational state in memory; it's hard to update atomically and doesn't survive memory clears.

**Over-scaffolding small projects.** If the project is <2 weeks of work, skip this whole thing. Use a single `NOTES.md` and move on. The overhead only pays back on multi-phase, multi-session builds.

**Commits that don't match steps.** A 500-line commit titled "WIP" breaks the whole git-as-progress-narrative idea. Commits should close steps or atomic units within a step. If a commit spans two sub-steps, split it or change the step boundary — don't pretend it's fine.

**Skipping the phase tag.** `phase-<N>-closed` tags are the rollback escape hatch and the regression bisection anchor. Skip them and you lose both. `/phase-close` creates the tag; do not close a phase manually.

**Filing everything as major.** Severity gating only works if you're honest — a typo is minor even if it annoyed you. If `.control/issues/OPEN/` grows faster than you close, you're probably over-filing.

**STATE.md fields left `<placeholder>`.** An unfilled placeholder in STATE.md reads as "the last person didn't know either." Every session-end must fill every field — if a field is genuinely inapplicable, write "n/a" with a one-word reason, not the template placeholder.

**Jumping straight to stage 3 autonomy.** Running `/loop /work-next` across phases on day one means trusting a priority logic you haven't validated. You'll wake up to commits that look right and aren't. Stay at stage 0 until at least one phase closes cleanly; stage 1 until the priority picks feel right; stage 2 until the HALT conditions catch everything they should.

**Fake HALT conditions.** If `/work-next` treats every minor uncertainty as a HALT, autonomy is useless — you're back to driving. If it never HALTs, you're at risk of confidently-wrong work. The line is: HALT when a human brings information Claude can't derive (domain knowledge, acceptance criteria, credentials, irreversibility). Don't HALT on "I'm not 100% sure" — that's what tests and the regression gate are for.
