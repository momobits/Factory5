# Roadmap — factory5 first-class upgrade

Four tiers, shippable independently. Tier order is dependency-aware: docs first because the rest reference them; channels before web UI because channel parity is the bigger felt gap; web UI rebuild is the heaviest tier; CLI completion is small.

## Status legend

- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress
- `[x]` complete

## Tier 1 — Doc + UX cleanup

Bringing the user-facing docs into line with reality. Estimated **1 session**.

- [x] Fix `packages/cli/README.md` — drop "Phase" column, add `spend` / `findings` / `questions cleanup` rows, re-evaluate stub/planned markers
- [x] Fix `packages/channels/README.md` — Telegram + web no longer "future"; add Telegram and Web sections
- [x] Fix `apps/factory-web/README.md` — remove phase-number references, add page index
- [x] Add §"Web dashboard" to `docs/ONBOARDING.md`
- [x] Add §"Chat — CLI / Discord / Telegram" to `docs/ONBOARDING.md`
- [x] Write `docs/WORKFLOWS.md` — four canonical loops + decision matrix + CLAUDE.md authoring guide
- [x] Reference `WORKFLOWS.md` from `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ONBOARDING.md`
- [x] Single-pass audit of `docs/SKILLS.md` + `docs/AGENTS.md` against current code

Plan: [`plans/tier-1-doc-sweep.md`](plans/tier-1-doc-sweep.md)

## Tier 2 — Channel parity

Discord/Telegram only emit `intent=build` and `intent=chat` today. Bring them up to the brain's full eight-intent vocabulary. Estimated **2 sessions**.

- [x] Discord slash commands — `/factory status / spend / findings / resume / cancel / budget / build` (registers `factory` slash, wires `interactionCreate` dispatch)
- [x] Discord embeds for status / findings / spend responses
- [x] Telegram bot commands — `setMyCommands` + matching parser (shared `command-handlers.ts` with Discord)
- [x] Telegram inline keyboard buttons on pending-question messages (Answer / Skip / Escalate)
- [x] Discord buttons on pending-question messages (same shape)
- [x] Add `factory cancel <directive-id>` — CLI command + IPC route + brain hook (kills worker, not just flips status)
- [x] Update triage prompt to classify chat across all 8 intents
- [x] Channel handlers re-route classified intents (e.g. `intent=status` from Telegram chat answers with status, not LLM chat)

Plan: [`plans/tier-2-channel-parity.md`](plans/tier-2-channel-parity.md)

## Tier 3 — Web UI live and complete

Vanilla DOM-in-Astro → real Astro components + live updates + complete operating surface. Estimated **2-3 sessions**.

- [x] SSE on `/api/v1/directives/:id/stream` — events: `task.*`, `finding.created`, `spend.updated`, `log.line`
- [x] Wire `directives/detail.astro` to the SSE stream (live tasks, findings, spend, log tail)
- [x] Astro component library — `<Card>`, `<Table>`, `<EmptyState>`, `<Alert>`, `<Form>`, `<PageShell>`
- [x] Convert all 10 pages to use components; retire `el()` (and `loadInto()`) from `lib/api.ts`
- [x] Add `/app/chat` page — mirror of `factory chat` in browser
- [x] Add cancel button on directive detail (pause deferred — operator workflow signal not present yet; see phase-3-web-ui/steps.md follow-up bullet)
- [x] Add `/app/projects/new` — mirror of `factory init` for a single project
- [x] Spend page charts — sparkline per project + 30-day daily stacked bar
- [x] Mobile-responsive nav (hamburger drawer at narrow widths)
- [x] Explicit logout + connection-status indicator in header

Plan: [`plans/tier-3-web-ui-live-and-complete.md`](plans/tier-3-web-ui-live-and-complete.md)

## Tier 4 — CLI completion

Polish. Estimated **1 session**.

- [x] `factory cancel <directive-id>` (shared with Tier 2; Phase 4.1 live-smoke verified the 4-code exit surface)
- [x] `factory budget set <project> --max-usd <n> [--max-steps <n>]`
- [x] `factory project list / show <name> / delete <name>`
- [x] `factory ask "<question>"` — single-shot chat
- [ ] Tab completion for bash/zsh/pwsh
- [ ] Rich `--help` examples on every command (`addHelpText('after', ...)`)

Plan: [`plans/tier-4-cli-completion.md`](plans/tier-4-cli-completion.md)

## Out of scope (now)

Items the audit raised that are deferred:

- **Bash sandboxing** — defer-on-incident; ADR 0028 §4 still applies; no demand signal yet.
- **Network egress scoping** — long-tail concern; wait for an egress-policy demand signal.
- **Multi-user UI auth** — single-operator design is OK for now.
- **Multi-tenant SaaS daemon** — out of charter.
- **VS Code extension** — out of charter.
- **Hosted "factory cloud"** — out of charter.

These can be promoted to Tier 5+ if/when the demand signal arrives.

## Dependencies between tiers

| Item                                                   | Depends on                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 2 channel parity (status/spend/findings handlers) | Tier 1 docs (so the in-channel responses can link to docs/WORKFLOWS.md) |
| Tier 3 cancel button                                   | Tier 2 `factory cancel` shared code path                                |
| Tier 3 SSE stream                                      | Independent (can ship before Tier 2)                                    |
| Tier 4 CLI cancel                                      | Tier 2 brain hook (worker-kill plumbing)                                |
| Tier 4 CLI budget                                      | Independent (already wired on web side)                                 |

So Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3 + Tier 4 in parallel works. Tier 3 and Tier 4 share no critical code, so a session can pick either.
